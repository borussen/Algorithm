# MST

Given a weighted undirected graph, provide the cost of a minimum spanning tree. Note that, your program can allocate up to 512MB memory and should produce the output within 3 seconds. <br>

<b>Input:</b> <br> 
In the first line, two integers 𝑛 (1 ≤ 𝑛 ≤ 10,000) and 𝑚 (1 ≤ 𝑚 ≤ 200,000) are given where 𝑛
and 𝑚 are the number of vertices and edges of the graph, respectively. The following lines describes
𝑚 edges in a format of “𝑎 𝑏 𝑐” indicating that the graph has an edge between vertices 𝑎 and 𝑏 with
cost of 𝑐 . Note that the vertex index begins with 1 and the cost 𝑐 can be negative but |𝑐| <
1,000,000. <br>

<b>Output:</b> <br>
You are required to output the cost of a minimum spanning tree. <br>
