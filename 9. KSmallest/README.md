# K-Smallest

Given 𝑁 numbers, implement an efficient algorithm to find 𝐾 smallest values among them.

a. The numbers are 32-bit positive integers smaller than 100,000,000.

b. 1,000,000 ≤ 𝑁 ≤ 100,000,000 and 10 ≤ 𝐾 ≤ 10,000

c. The smallest 𝐾 numbers should be reported in non-decreasing order.

d. The input file is a binary format: see the skeleton code.

e. The output file is a text file containing the 𝐾 numbers and runtime.

f. The input and output can have duplicates. In other words, there can be the equal numbers.

g. Your submission will be evaluated based on the correctness and runtime. For each test case, you will not get any credit if your program produces a wrong result.

h. Runtimes longer than 30 seconds will be considered as timeout.

i. Your program can allocate up to 16GB memory.
