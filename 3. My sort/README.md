# My sort

### Problem
Implement a sorting algorithm on the provided skeleton code. Assume that the number of objects 𝑁 ranges 1,000 ≤ 𝑁 ≤ 100,000,000 and the objects are 32-bit integers larger than −100,000,000 but smaller than 100,000,000. <br>

Your submission will be evaluated based on the correctness and runtime. For each test case, you will not get any credit if your program produces a wrong sorting result. <br><br>

### Tips
1) You need to specify input and output file names when executing your program.
    - The input file has a binary format: see the skeleton code.
    - The output file is a text file containing the validation result (OKAY or WRONG) and runtime.
2) You are recommended to consider various distributions of the input data. For instance, the values can be randomly distributed or focused on a certain range.
